# Carcassonne
Repository for my Thesis

The thesis is about implemetning Carcassonne, a popular strategy board game with .NET framework.
The game will feature a multiplayer game mode that can be played on local network, or on the same computer. This will be achieved
by using the MVVM architecture, and having the base logic of the game separated from the view, building a semi-server-client system.
